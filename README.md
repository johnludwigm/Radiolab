If you find any errors or have any suggestions for improvement, please let me know!

To use, simply run:

\>>> import radiolab


\>>> radiolab.parentdir = '/Users/YOU/Desktop' #<- example for Unix. You can pick wherever you want.


\>>> radiolab.main("Radiolab") #creates a directory /Users/YOU/Desktop/Radiolab where the episodes will be saved.



Even for episodes with weird titles, (e.g. "12: Proof", "(So-Called) Life") you have to enter the exact title name in order to download that specific episode.
