# Radiolab

Downloads episodes of Radiolab from radiolab.org.



If you find any errors or have any suggestions for improvement, please let me know!

To use, simply run:

 `python3 -m radiolab -dl <Episodes-that-you-want-to-download> -dest <path-to-download-destination>`



Even for episodes with weird titles, (e.g. "12: Proof", "(So-Called) Life") you have to enter the exact title name in order to download that specific episode. The exception is when there is a character that is not UTF-8 (e.g. "â‰¤ kg").
